    <h2>BMI introduction</h2>
    <p>BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on 
        their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. 
        It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a 
        healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained
         from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is 
         underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range 
         the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as 
         region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as
          severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight 
          can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of 
          healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional 
          testing or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different
           categories based on BMI that are used by the calculator.</p>
